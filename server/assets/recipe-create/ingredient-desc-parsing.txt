You will be getting a list of ingredients from a recipe.
Your task is to formalize the strings to make it easier to match the foods to a general database of common, unbranded foods. (now referred to as DB)

Guidelines:

For each ingredient you recieve, extract clearly:
- "name" = The input food - what people would have to go into the store and buy to make the recipe
- "extra" = Anything else, including specific descriptors, branding, specific variations, and what to do with the food in the recipe (preparation descriptor)
- Discard: Amount specifiers, alternatives to the food if present



Keep in mind that these will be displayed as "name, extra" on a website, to format accordingly.
"name" will then be used for searching the ingredient specified in a database.
Note that you can go pretty specific with the name, since there is a name matching system for the database. (see example below)
 Keep in mind that we do not want to lose important context with this conversion process. 


Some examples:
Input: "Tomatoes, san marzano, blended, canned, reduced"
Output: name: "Canned San Marzano Tomatoes", extra: "blended and reduced"
-> You dont have to put "San Marzano" variety in extra, since the system will make a new name entry for your name,
and point it to something like "Canned Tomatoes" and draw nutritional data from there
Input: "T-Bone Steak, 100g, grilled, or Entrecote"
Output: name: "T-Bone Steak", extra: "grilled"
