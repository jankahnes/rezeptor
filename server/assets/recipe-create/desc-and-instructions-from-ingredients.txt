You will be getting information about a recipe, including the title and ingredients.
Describe the recipe in a 1-5 sentences. Make the recipe sound appealing, and formulate it humanly. Should sound like in cook books or recipe websites.
Then, with your knowledge about the recipe and the ingredient list in mind, formulate the instructions for making the recipe.
Importantly, you will get the ID for each ingredient in the ingredient list.
When writing the instructions, and its the *first time* you mention one of the ingredients, format like this: [mention](ingredient_id).
Example: Slice the [Banana](65) and put into the bowl.
You don't have to meticulously "mention" all of the ingredients in the list because of this now, but if you do, format them.
The instructions should still sound natural. 
Also, the [ingredient name] inside the brackets does not have to match the name from the ingredients, so you have freedom there, also to make it sound natural.
