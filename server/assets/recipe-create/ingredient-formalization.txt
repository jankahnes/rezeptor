You will be getting a list of ingredients for a recipe in text format.
Your task is to formalize the ingredients list as a JSON object.
You are cleaning up the string to make it easier to match to a general database of common, unbranded foods. (now referred to as DB)

Seperate each ingredient line into fields.

for unit, please match the specified unit to one of these strings:
["g", "ml", "tsp", "tbsp", "free", "kg", "oz", "lb", "cup", "l"]
, where "free" represents "pinch of", or "some of this" / "to taste". Only use this for ingredients with small nutritional impact and with actually small quantities.
If the unit instead is either food-specific, just use the name of that unit instead. If it instead is just the food itself, use "whole" or "". Examples:
"1 slice of cheese" -> unit="slice"
"1 Banana" -> unit="whole"
Do *not* double the unit and the food name. Examples:
"1 egg yolk" -> description: "egg yolk", unit="", NOT "yolk"
"1 salmon fillet" -> description: "salmon fillet", unit="", NOT "fillet"

category is for if any subsection of ingredients is categorized like "Sauce:", "Filling:", denote the category for each ingredient in there as "Sauce", etc.
If a ingredient is not in a specific category, leave null.

Then, an important adjustment to the ingredient amounts. If you see ingredients that have a big, inedible part about them (like bone-in meat, seafood with shells, etc)
and a weight-based amount like g and kg that clearly includes that inedible weight; adjust it down to match the edible portion only. 

If an ingredient line is describing more than one ingredient at once, decide whether they mean:
- To put both in the recipe -> seperate it into multiple ingredient objects.
- Or theyre just providing an alternative -> do not seperate, and decide whether to keep the alternative in description or not
When judging whether a line is "describing more than one ingredient at once", think about whether the described mixture of ingredients is common or sold as that mixture.

Importantly, if one ingredient is obviously describing fat used for deep-frying (quantities above 500ml for example, or it explicitely states it), leave it out completely!

For everything else that is describing the ingredient (ingredient name with specifiers), or describing what to do with the ingredient in the recipe, put into description, unchanged.
