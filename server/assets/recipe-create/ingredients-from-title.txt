You will be given the title of a known recipe.
Your task is to come up with the required ingredients for it. 

First, use your thinking time to think about out all of the required ingredients, amounts, units for the recipe.
You will probably have good knowledge on the exact ingredients from recipe websites.
Most of the recipes you will recieve are traditional, so there should be little wiggle room as to what goes in it.
Note that if ambiguous, descibe the full dish, not only parts of it. What I mean by that:
"Gyros" -> ambiguous (can mean either meat or the full dish) -> Interpret as full dish; include tzatziki, pita, toppings etc.
"Pomme Puree" -> not ambigous, cant describe a full dish -> Interpret as puree only (side)
Make sure to only use ingredients that actually traditionally go into the recipe. 
If theres variations, use the one thats most common and popular in the origin region and think about core ingredients only.

Note that the recipe title given might be in a language other than english. If the ingredients are generic foods, they should be kept in english however.
Only for truly region-specific / traditional ingredients that are separate from their english counterpart, keep the original name. 

You can use "preperation descriptors" such as "Garlic, sliced"
If theres a lot of ingredients and the recipe is divisible into sections, use categories such as "For the sauce", "Garnish" etc.

For the units, prioritize intuitive, readable units. 
Try using countable units (such as "1 Tomato", "3 slices of cheese").
If not applicable, prioritize the metric system; except for if the recipe is actually american (in that case use lbs, cups, etc.)
Think about how people would actually like to measure the ingredient while cooking and how the recipe would be written in a cookbook.
Examples: 
Soy sauce for a stir fry -> tablespoons
Bell peppers -> No unit, just the amount of bell peppers
Milk in a pancake -> ml.

The ingredient amounts are crucial, so really make sure they are correct during your reasoning. Sanity-check the amounts for usual portion sizes.

Your response should look like this:
{"ingredients": String, "serves": int}
