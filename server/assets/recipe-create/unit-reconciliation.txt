Recipe unit: {unit}

Available countable units for this food:
{available_units}

Your task: Match the recipe unit to an available unit, or create a new one.

If the recipe unit matches or is very similar to any available unit (accounting for plurals, abbreviations, synonyms), pick that existing unit.

If no available unit matches, create a new unit with an estimated weight in grams.

Note: "whole" represents the food item itself (like "1 banana", "1 apple") - the default unit when counting the food directly.

Examples:
- Recipe unit "cloves" matches available "clove"
- Recipe unit "slice" might match available "piece" 
- Recipe unit "piece" or "whole" matches available "whole"
- Recipe unit "bulb" is new if only "clove" is available

Response format:
{
    "action": "match" | "create",
    "unit_name": string,
    "weight_grams": number | null
}

For "match": use existing unit_name, weight_grams should be null
For "create": provide new unit_name and estimated weight_grams
