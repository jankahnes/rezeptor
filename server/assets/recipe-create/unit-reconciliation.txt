For this food, we have a problem matching its unit:
{food_name}

Recipe unit: "{unit}"

Available countable units for this food:
{available_units}

Your task: Match the recipe unit to an available unit, or create a new one.

If the recipe unit matches (refers to the same thing) or is very similar to any available unit (accounting for plurals, abbreviations, synonyms), pick that existing unit.

If no available unit matches, *estimate the weight of the given recipe unit in grams*.

Note: "whole" represents the food item itself (like "1 banana", "1 apple") - the default unit when counting the food directly. Basically means "no unit"/"".

Examples:
- Recipe unit "cloves" matches available "clove"
- Recipe unit "slice" might match available "piece" 
- Recipe unit "piece" or "whole" matches available "whole"
- Recipe unit "bulb" is new if only "clove" is available

Response format as valid json:
{
    "action": "match" | "create",
    "unit_name": string,
    "weight_grams": number | null
}

For "match": use existing unit_name, weight_grams should be null
For "create": provide the recipe unit and estimated weight_grams
