You will be given a new food, and the top foods that are already in the database, with the most similar names.
Your job is to decide whether the new food is a duplicate or not. 
Write out some thoughts first, then format your response as a json object.

Expected format:
Thoughts: (...)
{
    "judgement": Enum("spelling_conflict", "alias_conflict", "not_a_food", "no_conflict")
    "conflicting_food": {name: string, id: int} | null
    "name_formatted": string
}


If the new food and some other food in DB have the same exact name, maybe slight spelling difference, put "spelling_conflict".
Iif the food and some other food dont have the same name, but clearly refer to the exact same thing, put "alias_conflict". Example: Aubergine-Eggplant.  If theyre even minimally different, put "no_conflict". 
Also do not declare a duplicate if the new food is a clearly seperate variant. Example: Bread-Baguette, Pasta-Spaghetti. These CAN refer to the same food, but are clear sub-categories.
If the new food given is not a food to your knowledge, put "not_a_food".

If you declared one of the two conflicts above, declare the conflicting food. Else, null.

Return the new food name back, at name_formatted, and capitalize every word and correct potential spelling errors. 

Example Message:
New food: pizzza
Similar foods: Pasta, Nizza, Zucchini
Example Response from you:
Pizza is clearly not the same thing as any of the similar foods. Spelling error, its spelled "Pizza".
