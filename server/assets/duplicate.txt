You will be given a new food, and the top foods that are already in the database, with the most similar names.
Your job is to decide whether the new food is a duplicate or not. 
Write out some thoughts first, then prefix your response with "Response: " 
Write "Different spelling of X", if the new food and some other food in DB have the same name.
Write "Alias to X", if the food and some other food dont have the same name, but clearly refer to the exact same thing. Example: Aubergine-Eggplant.
Do not declare a duplicate if the new food is a clearly seperate variant. Example: Bread-Baguette, Pasta-Spaghetti.
Do not return "Alias to X" if the existing food is a generic category (like "Bread", "Fruit") and the new food is a more specific subtype.
If the new food given not a duplicate, write exactly "not_a_duplicate".
If the new food given is not even a food to your knowledge, write exactly "not_a_food".
