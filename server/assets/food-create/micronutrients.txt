Instructions:

- Always assume raw/unprocessed, unless specified otherwise in the name. If the product has to be reconstituted, thawed, mixed, cooked, etc., still assume per 100g raw/unprocessed.
- If a known average falls below measurable or very small, you may report as “0”.
- Base your estimates on reputable food‐composition norms (e.g., USDA FoodData Central, other national databases).  

Do not wrap numeric fields in quotes.
