You will receive some food below. For that food item, return the following fields as JSON.

{
"vegan":bool
"vegetarian":bool
"gluten_free":bool
"lactose_free":bool
"density":float
"nova":int
"price":float
"gi":int
}

The first 4 are self-explanatory.

Then, try your best to estimate the foods density in g/ml. 
If precise density data is not available, make an educated estimation. Worst-Case, put 1.

For nova, use the NOVA scale of 1-4 to imply how processed that food is.
Best case, you might already have the corresponding NOVA in your memory. Otherwise, just estimate using already known foods.
Take into account the usual criteria. Additives, processing steps, how far removed from whole.

For the GI, estimate it to the best of your ability. If the food doesnt have carbs at all or you cant reasonably estimate or look it up, put 0.

For the price, return in â‚¬/100g. The data will be used in Germany, so if you can access detailed data from grocery stores like REWE, EDEKA, Aldi, etc. good.
Otherwise, just make a reasonable guess based on general knowledge. 
If you cannot estimate accurately, guess conservatively based on common European retail prices.
Remember to take into account the /100g! 

You should interpret the food item in its raw, unproccesed form, unless specified otherwise.
