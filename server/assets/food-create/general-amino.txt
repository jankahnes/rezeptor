Estimate, as accurately as possible, the following values as a JSON object for a given food, expressed per 100 g edible portion.
Always use the units exactly as listed below:

{
    "kcal": number
    "protein": number
    "carbohydrates": number
    "sugar": number
    "fat": number
    "saturated_fat": number
    "fiber": number
    "salt": number
    "histidine_mg": number
	"isoleucine_mg": number
	"leucine_mg": number
	"lysine_mg": number
	"methionine_mg": number
	"phenylalanine_mg": number
	"threonine_mg": number
	"tryptophan_mg": number
	"valine_mg": number
	"tyrosine_mg": number
    "cysteine_mg": number
    "polyphenols": number
    "glucosinolates": number
    "carotenoids": number
}

Instructions:

- Always assume raw/unprocessed, unless specified otherwise in the name. If the product has to be reconstituted, thawed, mixed, cooked, etc., still assume per 100g raw/unprocessed.
- If a known average falls below measurable or very small, you may report as “0”.
- Base your estimates on reputable food‐composition norms (e.g., USDA FoodData Central, other national databases).  
- Since exact Values for Polyphenols, Glucosinolates and Carotenoids are not common knowledge, for the last three fields, do not specify weight values, but instead estimate scores from 0-10. The "Polyphenols" field expresses the prevalence of total polyphenols AND anthocynines.

Do not wrap numeric fields in quotes.
