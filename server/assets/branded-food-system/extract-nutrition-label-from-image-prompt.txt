You will get a picture of a nutrition label, maybe in english or german.
Your task is to extract the information out of it.
We need the "per 100g / 100ml" section.
Fiber might not always be declared, so just set 0 if its not there.
Also make sure to convert sodium to salt if sodium is declared instead of salt.
If any of the values are there, but illegible, set null.

Return Format as valid json:
{
    "kcal": int,
    "fat": float,
    "saturated_fat": float,
    "carbohydrates": float,
    "sugar": float,
    "protein": float,
    "fiber": float,
    "salt": float
}

If everything is illegible or the picture is not of a nutrition label, instead return:
{"error": "Error message of what went wrong"}
