Youre tasked with looking up this branded product in a database of generic foods.
The product name might be german or in another language, the database is in english.
The product name is: "{product_name}" from the brand "{brand}"
{category_line}

Since your matched food is primarily used for looking up nutritional data, the most important thing is that your generic food name matches closely to the product nutrition wise.
Specifics about the product are only secondary and often can be left out.
You should omit the brand name almost always, unless it defines the product itself. ("Oreos")
Stick to simple, precise names without parentheses or specificites.
*Your task is just to find the most generic food name that still matches closely to the product nutrition wise.*

Return as a JSON {{"generic_name": "...", "confidence": ...}} object and include how confident you are that the foods match sufficiently.
If you dont understand or are not confident about what generic food name to return at all, but additional information like ingredients or nutrition might help, use confidence = 0.

Examples:
- "Müller Reis Vanilla" → {{"generic_name": "rice pudding", "confidence": 0.9}} -> Flavor is not relevant to nutrition, so leave out
- "Coca-Cola Zero" → {{"generic_name": "sugar free softdrink", "confidence": 0.98}} -> Softdrink variety is not relevant for nutrition, so leave out 
- "Dr. Oetker Pizza Salami" → {{"generic_name": "frozen salami pizza", "confidence": 0.8}} -> Infer frozen from context
- "Weihenstephan Vollmilch 3.5%" → {{"generic_name": "whole milk", "confidence": 0.95}} -> Leaving out 3.5% is arguable, but whole milk always has around that percentage of fat, so redundant.
- "Gut & Günstig Sahnejoghurt" → {{"generic_name": "cream yogurt", "confidence": 0.85}}
