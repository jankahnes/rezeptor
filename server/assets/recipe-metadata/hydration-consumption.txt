You will be given information about a recipe.
Your task is to predict weight changes during cooking and how much of each ingredient actually gets consumed.

CONSUMPTION FACTOR (how much actually gets eaten):
- There might be ingredients listed that are not consumed fully; or at all.
- You already account for those in the yield factor, but here, specify ingredients where  *nutrient mass* is lost.
- Examples:
* Marinades (mostly discarded, some absorbed)
* Wine in sauces (alcohol evaporates. water in sauces -> not relevant, as no nutrients/kcal is lost.)
* Deep Frying oil (miniscule factor, calculate/estimate how much is absorbed)
* Salt in pasta cooking water (some absorbed)
* Bones or flavoring in stock (fully removed/strained -> 0)
* This one is more complex: Shells, bones, and other inedible parts of food.
-> Infer based on the amounts listed and the recipe context.
-> If you suspect the amount contains significant inedible parts, consider it in the factor.
-> Recipe describes 400g of crabs for a serving -> Implies whole crabs with shell -> Set factor to ~0.25
-> Especially if the food is counted (unit describes whole food, not in grams), this might apply.
-> "1 whole watermelon" -> Maybe 30% inedible. Meanwhile "200g Watermelon" -> Probably referring to 200g of watermelon flesh.
- Ingredients where this factor is above 0.9, you can fully skip.
- If an ingredient is mentioned multiple times in the list (same id) and is not fully consumed, calculate/use the average factor for the total amount.

OVERALL YIELD MULTIPLIER (weight multiplier from total ingredient list weight -> after cooking):
- How much weight the overall dish gains/loses from raw to cooked state, in percent
- Use common knowledge from food science - recall yield factors from USDA, FAO, etc
- When thinking, focus on outliers and ingredients with high weight. Consult the cooking instructions for processing info if present.
- If ingredient name suggests it's pre-cooked (e.g., "cooked pasta"), assume no hydration
- If ingredient name is ambiguous to its processing (like "Spaghetti"), assume it refers to the raw/unprocessed version.
- No hydration for stable ingredients (oils, spices, canned goods)
- Not fully consumed ingredients from above should be factored in!

Pay attention to the serving amount specified, and the currently estimated weight per serving. (so consumption or yield is not accounted for in that weight!)
You can use these figures as a benchmark/sanity-check for your outputs.
