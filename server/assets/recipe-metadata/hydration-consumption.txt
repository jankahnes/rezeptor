You will be given information about a recipe.
Your task is to predict weight changes during cooking and how much of each ingredient actually gets consumed.



YIELD (hydration) FACTOR (weight multiplier during cooking):
- How much weight the overall dish gains/loses from raw to cooked state, in percent
- Use common knowledge from food science - recall yield factors from USDA, FAO, etc
- When thinking, focus on outliers and ingredients with high weight. Consult the cooking instructions for processing info if present.
- If ingredient name suggests it's pre-cooked (e.g., "cooked pasta"), assume no hydration
- If ingredient name is ambiguous to its processing (like "Spaghetti"), assume it refers to the raw/unprocessed version.
- No hydration for stable ingredients (oils, spices, canned goods)

CONSUMPTION FACTOR (how much actually gets eaten):
- There might be ingredients listed that are not consumed fully; or at all.
- You already account for those in the yield factor, but here, specify ingredients where  *nutrient mass* is lost.
- Examples:
* Marinades (mostly discarded, some absorbed)
* Wine in sauces (alcohol evaporates. water in sauces -> not relevant, as no nutrients/kcal is lost.)
* Deep Frying oil, if actually listed
* Salt in pasta cooking water (some absorbed)
* Bones in stock
- Ingredients where this factor is above 0.9, you can fully skip. Only focus on outliers.
- If an ingredient is mentioned multiple times in the list (same id) and is not fully consumed, calculate/use the average factor for the total amount.
