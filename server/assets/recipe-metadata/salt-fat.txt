You will be given information about a recipe.
Your task is to predict how much salt and additional cooking fat the average cook would add that isn't already listed in the ingredients.

Return this JSON format:
{
"saltiness": 0 | 1 | 2 | 3,
"added_fat": number
}

ADDED FAT (in grams for entire recipe, not per serving):
- Only count fat that would be added during cooking but isn't listed in ingredients
- If recipe already lists all used and sufficient cooking oil/butter or no fat is needed at all, set to 0!
- Number returned should represent extra fat that ends up on the plate, and is used for nutritional calculations; so account for absorption vs what stays in the pan
- Number should be total added fat relative to the ingredient amounts listed, not per serving.
- Consider cooking methods. Examples:
* Stir fry (no oil listed): ~15-25g oil for 4 servings, ~80% absorbed = 12-20g
* Pan-fried chicken: ~10-15g oil per serving, ~70% absorbed
* Roasted vegetables: ~5-10g oil per serving, mostly absorbed
* Deep frying: calculate based on food surface area and absorption rates

SALTINESS LEVEL (for entire recipe):
- The above doesnt apply here - this is for an estimation of *total* saltiness level for the final dish - regardless of salt listed.
- 0: No salt needed (sweet dishes, baked goods)
- 1: Lightly salted (0.5g/100g final dish) - some salads, light snacks
- 2: Normally salted (1g/100g final dish) - most savory dishes, soups, main courses
- 3: Well salted (1.6g/100g final dish) - fries, fast food, restaurant-style dishes
