You will be given information about a recipe.
Your task is to infer, per ingredient, how that ingredient is processed when making that recipe. 
As instructions may be missing, you may have to infer processing based on common cooking methods, recipe title, and ingredient composition.
Example: Potatoes are typically cooked (never eaten raw), pasta is boiled, onions are often sautéed. Salad is never cooked.

Definitions:
THERMAL INTENSITY (omit if no heat applied):
- LOW: 50-99°C (simmering, gentle warming)
- MEDIUM: 100-180°C (boiling, baking, standard cooking)  
- HIGH: 180°C+ (frying, grilling, roasting at high heat)

HEAT MEDIUM (omit if no heat applied):
- WET: ingredient submerged in water/liquid (boiling, poaching, braising)
- FAT: fat is primary heat transfer (pan-frying, deep-frying, sautéing)
- DRY: air/surface heat (roasting, baking, grilling, steaming)
- RADIATION: microwave cooking

MECHANICAL DISRUPTION:
- 0: Intact/whole (whole vegetables, whole cuts of meat)
- 1: Minimal prep (chopped, diced, sliced)
- 2: Highly processed (blended, pureed, ground, mashed)
