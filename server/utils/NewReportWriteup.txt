NUTRITION REPORT - HUMAN-READABLE PHRASINGS & THRESHOLDS
===========================================================

This document defines the human-readable output for each nutrition category based on the new scoring system.

General Principles:
- Official standards (FDA, EU regulations) take precedence where they exist
- Thresholds should be based on actual metric values, not scores (to avoid circular logic)
- Use per-100g or per-serving metrics where meaningful
- Include contextual information (contributors, ratios) where valuable


1. MICRONUTRIENTS ✓ (Already well-defined)
==========================================

Available metrics: {name, displayName, value, nutrientPer2000kcal, percentRDA, rdaPer100, rdaPerServing, nutrientScore, weightedScore}

OFFICIAL FDA/EU STANDARDS (per 100g):
- <5% RDA: Not displayed / "Trace"
- 5-15% RDA: "Low source of"
- 15-35% RDA: "Source of"
- 35-50% RDA: "High in"
- 50-75% RDA: "Excellent source of"
- 75%+ RDA: "Exceptionally high in"

Display threshold: 10% RDA per 100g (current system is good)
Sort by: RDA per 100g (descending)
Include: Contributor breakdown for recipes (not foods)

STATUS: Already implemented correctly in micronutrientsToReadable.ts


2. FIBER
========

Available metrics: {fiberPer100g, fiberPer2000kcal, fiberRDAPer2000kcal}

THRESHOLDS (per 100g):
Most recipes/foods fall in 0-3g range, needs granular steps
- <0.5g: "Very low fiber" (POOR)

- 2.5-3.5g: "High fiber" (GOOD/GREAT)
- 3.5-5g: "Very high fiber" (GREAT)
- 5g+: "Excellent fiber" (EXCELLENT)

Note: FDA "high fiber" claim requires 5g/serving (or 6g/100g for foods), but this is
too high a bar for typical foods/recipes

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT (fiberRDAPer2000kcal):
Secondary display showing "on track" status:
- <0.5 (15g/2000kcal): "Below recommended" (SUBOPTIMAL)

9. SATIETY
==========

Available metrics: {ff, giProxy, water, kcal}

Display strategy:
- Primary: Fullness factor + verbal description
- Context 1: Energy density (kcal)
- Context 2: Glycemic proxy (for carb-rich foods)
- Don't display water explicitly (redundant with energy density)


SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
===================

- Omega-6/Omega-3 ratio removed (not scientifically justified, not used in scoring)
- Sugar phrasing differentiated: "concentration" vs "energy contribution"
- Fiber thresholds made more granular for 0-3g range (where most foods fall)
- Protective compounds use unified phrasing across all three types
- All metrics available in current system
